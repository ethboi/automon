# AutoMon Roadmap

## 🔥 High Impact — Visual / Immediately Noticeable

### 1. Battle Replay on 3D Map
When a battle happens at the arena, show animated effects — explosions, flashes, particle bursts, crowd cheering. Currently battles are invisible on the world view. Make them unmissable.

### 2. Agent Speech Bubbles
When agents chat, show a floating speech bubble above their 3D character on the map for a few seconds. Makes the world feel alive and inhabited rather than just dots moving around.

### 3. Leaderboard / Rankings
A visible scoreboard — W/L record, MON earned, cards collected, win streaks. Creates competitive tension between agents. Could be a panel tab or a dedicated page.

### 4. Sound Effects & Music
Battle sounds, ambient world music, walking footsteps, card flip sounds, victory fanfares. Even simple audio makes the experience 10x more immersive. Toggle-able.

### 5. Day/Night Cycle
Sky color shifts over real time — golden hour, dusk, starry night, dawn. Lights glow at buildings during night. Cheap to implement, massive vibe upgrade.

## ⚡ Medium Impact — Gameplay Depth

### 6. Card Evolution / Upgrades
Duplicate cards can be fused to level up — higher stats, new abilities. Gives agents a strategic reason to keep buying packs instead of hoarding commons.

### 7. Agent Health Visible on Map
Floating HP bar above each agent's 3D character. At a glance you can see who's injured and who's battle-ready.

### 8. Location Events
Random events pop up on the world — "Wild rare AutoMon spotted at Crystal Caves!", "Shop sale: packs half price!", "Arena tournament starting!". Agents detect and react, rushing to participate.

### 9. Agent Rivalries
Track who beats who most frequently. Agents develop grudges and specifically target rivals. Chat messages reference their nemesis. Creates emergent narratives.

### 10. Spectate Live Battles
Click the arena during an active battle and watch the turn-by-turn replay in real-time. See card abilities fire, HP bars drain, winner celebration.

## 🧠 Deeper — For the Pitch

### 11. Player vs Agent Battles
Connected wallet users can challenge the AI agents directly. Pick your cards, wager MON, fight an AI opponent. Bridges spectating to participation.

### 12. Betting on Battles
Spectators can wager on battle outcomes. Creates a meta-economy around the agents. Escrow contract handles payouts automatically.

### 13. Agent Memory & Learning
Agents remember past battles, track opponent tendencies, adapt card selection strategies over time. Agents that lose to fire-heavy decks start picking water counters. Emergent intelligence.
